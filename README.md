# Customer Churn Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling on a Telco customer dataset to identify the factors that influence customer churn.

## 📊 Objective

The main goal is to understand why customers leave a telecom company and build a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn, so that strategies can be made to retain them.
